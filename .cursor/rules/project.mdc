### Step-by-Step Development Plan

This plan is broken into 10 phases, starting with basic setup and progressively adding complexity. Each phase builds on the previous one, allowing for iterative development and testing.

#### Phase 1: Set Up the Development Environment

- **Objective**: Establish the foundation for the project.
- **Steps**:
  - Install Node.js and a package manager (e.g., npm).
  - Set up a basic ThreeJS project with a simple scene (e.g., a cube or plane rendered in the browser).
  - Integrate a networking library (e.g., Socket.IO) and test basic client-server communication (e.g., sending a "hello" message between clients).

#### Phase 2: Implement Basic Player Movement

- **Objective**: Enable player control in a 3D space.
- **Steps**:
  - Create a first-person camera controller using ThreeJS.
  - Implement keyboard controls (e.g., WASD for movement) and mouse controls for looking around.
  - Add basic collision detection to prevent players from passing through walls or objects.

#### Phase 3: Add Lean Mechanics

- **Objective**: Introduce the signature lean feature inspired by "Rainbow Six Siege."
- **Steps**:
  - Modify the camera controller to support leaning left and right (e.g., using Q and E keys).
  - Ensure leaning adjusts only the camera’s position, not the player’s hitbox or world position.
  - Test the lean mechanics in the simple scene to verify smooth and intuitive operation.

#### Phase 4: Implement Shooting Mechanics

- **Objective**: Add combat functionality to the game.
- **Steps**:
  - Add a crosshair to the screen center for aiming.
  - Implement shooting using raycasting from the camera to detect hits on objects or players.
  - Use a hitscan approach (instant hits) for simplicity.
  - Add basic visual or audio feedback for shooting (e.g., a sound effect).

#### Phase 5: Integrate Multiplayer Networking

- **Objective**: Enable real-time multiplayer gameplay.
- **Steps**:
  - Set up a server to manage player connections and game state.
  - Synchronize player positions, rotations, and lean states across all clients.
  - Handle shooting events server-side to calculate damage and prevent cheating.
  - Implement basic interpolation to smooth out movement despite network latency.

#### Phase 6: Design a Simple Map

- **Objective**: Create a playable environment.
- **Steps**:
  - Build a basic 3D map with walls, floors, and obstacles using ThreeJS.
  - Design the layout to support tactical gameplay, with cover areas for leaning and hiding.
  - Optimize the map for performance by using simple geometry and efficient textures.

#### Phase 7: Implement Team Mechanics

- **Objective**: Introduce team-based gameplay.
- **Steps**:
  - Divide players into two teams of five.
  - Add team indicators in the UI (e.g., colored nametags or icons).
  - Implement a simple game mode, such as team deathmatch (most kills wins).
  - Prevent friendly fire for simplicity by disabling damage to teammates.

#### Phase 8: Add UI Elements

- **Objective**: Enhance player feedback and game information.
- **Steps**:
  - Create health bars visible to each player (and optionally teammates).
  - Display ammo counts if limited ammunition is included.
  - Add a scoreboard showing team scores, kills, and deaths.
  - Include a basic menu for starting or restarting the game.

#### Phase 9: Testing and Optimization

- **Objective**: Ensure the game runs smoothly and reliably.
- **Steps**:
  - Test with multiple players to check synchronization, performance, and bugs.
  - Optimize rendering (e.g., reduce draw calls, adjust detail levels).
  - Fine-tune networking to minimize latency and ensure fluid gameplay.
  - Fix issues with collisions, shooting, or leaning identified during testing.

#### Phase 10: Polish and Final Touches

- **Objective**: Refine the game for a better experience.
- **Steps**:
  - Add sound effects (e.g., footsteps, gunshots).
  - Include basic player models and animations (e.g., walking, shooting) if time permits.
  - Adjust game balance (e.g., health, damage) based on playtesting feedback.
  - Add visual effects (e.g., muzzle flash, particles) to enhance immersion.

This structured approach ensures the game is built incrementally, starting with core functionality and expanding to include multiplayer features, lean mechanics, and polish. Each phase can be tested independently, making it easier to identify and resolve issues as development progresses.
